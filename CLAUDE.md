# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for working in this repository. Read `docs/` for the full design;
this file is the short, operational version plus the non-obvious invariants.

## What this is

Void Dominion — a mobile, **real-time**, massively-multiplayer space grand strategy
(Bytro-style genre, original everything). Real-time means continuous wall-clock time
that runs 24/7 even while the player is offline — **not turn-based**; "asynchronous"
describes the play pattern (drop in, issue orders that take real hours, drop out). The
whole bet is a **flexible, extensible core**: add mechanics/units/factions through data,
not by rewriting logic.

Monorepo (pnpm workspaces):

- `packages/shared-core` — the deterministic, data-driven simulation. Built first,
  in isolation (no server, no DB, no network). This is where the work currently is.
- `packages/server` — authoritative server (Stage 3). Placeholder.
- `packages/client` — React Native client (Stage 4). Placeholder.
- `data/` — game content as JSON. `docs/` — design docs.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run check        # lint + typecheck + test — run this before committing
pnpm test             # Vitest
pnpm run lint         # ESLint (flat config)
pnpm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit, all packages
pnpm run format       # Prettier --write
```

CI runs lint + typecheck + test + `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`.

## Non-negotiable invariants

These come straight from the design docs. Breaking them is a bug, not a style choice.

1. **Determinism.** `shared-core` is a pure function: same `(state, action, context)`
   → same result. No `Math.random()` and no `Date.now()` anywhere in the core — use
   the seeded `Rng` and take time via `Context.now`. ESLint enforces this in
   `packages/shared-core/src/**` (non-test). The RNG stream is locked by a golden
   test (`rng.test.ts`); if you intentionally change the algorithm, update the golden
   values, and understand it invalidates replays of existing matches.
2. **Purity / immutability.** `applyAction` never mutates its input `state`. It works
   on a `deepClone` draft and returns a new state. `GameState` must stay
   JSON-serializable (it is persisted as JSONB) — no class instances, Maps, Dates, or
   functions inside it.
3. **Modules talk only through the bus.** No module imports another module. The three
   mechanisms are events (pub/sub reactions), hooks (value pipelines with a base
   default), and the capability registry (optional links with a fallback). Every
   extension point must degrade gracefully: no module present → base default, never a
   crash. See `docs/modulesystem.md`.
4. **Fail-secure (OWASP A10).** Any error → rejection, never a silent pass. The reducer
   returns `{ ok: false, code }` with a stable error code only — no internal detail
   leaks to the caller (details belong in server logs). `h.reject(code)` is the
   intended path; unexpected throws become `E_INTERNAL`.
5. **Server-authority.** The client sends intent, never state. Validation/authorization/
   idempotency live in the action layer (Stage 2, not built yet); the core reducer
   assumes an action already cleared those gates.
6. **Determinism of module order.** Module execution order = their order in the array
   passed to `createKernel`, recorded in `kernel.manifest` and versioned per match.
   Don't introduce order-dependent behavior that isn't driven by that fixed order.

## Architecture quick map

`createKernel(modules)` compiles an immutable kernel from an ordered module list. It
exposes two pure entry points:

- `applyAction(state, action, ctx)` — apply a player's intent at `ctx.now`.
- `advanceTo(state, ctx)` — move the world clock to `ctx.now`, firing due scheduled
  events in `(at, seq)` order and emitting a contiguous `time.advanced` { from, to }
  event for each continuous span (so modules accrue resources by formula, not ticks).
  Real-time server flow: `advanceTo` to the present, then `applyAction`.

A module's `setup(api)` registers: `onAction(type, h)` (one handler per type),
`on(event, h)`, `hook(name, fn)`, `provideCapability(name, impl)`. Handlers receive a
`HandlerContext` with the draft `state`, `ctx` (now + validated game data), the `rng`,
`emit`, `schedule(at, type, payload)` (express a future occurrence / real-time
duration), `hook`, `capability`, and `reject`. A scheduled event whose handler throws is
dead-lettered (dropped, recorded in `failures`) so the timeline never gets stuck.

New game mechanic = new module (subscribe to events + register hooks) + maybe new JSON
data. You should not need to touch the kernel.

## Toolchain notes / gotchas

- **zod v4** is installed. Use the two-arg `z.record(keySchema, valueSchema)` form.
  `safeParseGameData` returns `z.ZodSafeParseResult<GameData>`.
- **`shared-core/tsconfig.json` sets `types: ["node"]`** so tests can read `data/*.json`
  via `node:fs`. This is for typechecking convenience only — the core's no-Node/
  no-`Date` discipline is enforced by ESLint, not by withholding the types. Don't import
  Node built-ins from non-test `shared-core/src` files.
- Game data is split into `data/*.json` fragments + `data/manifest.json` (version).
  A loader composes them into one bundle and runs `parseGameData` (see
  `schemas.test.ts` for the exact composition). All external data is validated before
  it reaches the core (A05/A08).
- Tests live next to source as `*.test.ts`. The root `vitest.config.ts` discovers them.

## Working agreements

- Run `pnpm run check` before committing; keep CI green.
- When you finish a roadmap milestone, update the "Статус реализации" section in
  `docs/roadmap.md`.
- Development happens on the feature branch; open a PR (draft) after pushing.
