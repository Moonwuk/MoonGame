/**
 * Node-threat scan — «враг близко к расположению» (ST-3.1, steward-roadmap).
 *
 * A PURE, deterministic read answering one question for a defender: which
 * hostile fleets bear on this node right now — already at it, inbound to it,
 * or camped on one of its lanes? The Steward's evacuation/commit logic (and any
 * HUD warning) keys off this list; the scan itself decides nothing. Call it on
 * a state advanced to `ctx.now` (the server flow: `advanceTo` → read) — the
 * visibility anchors interpolate moving fleets at `state.time`.
 *
 * FOG-HONEST by construction: only fleets `viewerId` currently IDENTIFIES are
 * reported (`isVisibleTo` — the exact rule `visibleState` projects by), so a
 * server-side driver acting for one player reacts only to what that player
 * could legitimately see on their own map. A radar-only blip is NOT a threat
 * yet — composition is unknown, so no forecast could be run against it anyway.
 *
 * Hostility is the D1 stance read (`getStance === 'war'`, unrecorded pairs
 * default to war — FFA), the same base mapping the `diplomacy` capability
 * projects, matching `isHostile`'s no-capability fallback (invariant #3).
