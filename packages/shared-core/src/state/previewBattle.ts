/**
 * Combat preview — «если атакую — что будет?» (ONB-6 / G4, onboarding-roadmap §ONB-6).
 *
 * A PURE what-if over the combat module's own round engine: the same simultaneous
 * round — aggressor fires `attack`, the standing side answers with `defense` — the
 * same tier-ordered pure damage model (`damageUnits`: front→mid→rear→artillery,
 * ablative shields first, whole units lost as pools drop), the same stalemate
 * valve. Inputs are never mutated (the sim runs on deep clones); no bus, no
 * schedule, no RNG — combat resolution is fully deterministic.
 *
 * It is a FORECAST, not an oracle (the spec's bar is sign-agreement, not
 * equality): the live battle additionally pipes each round through the
 * `combat.damage` hook — terrain, planet type, standing fortifications, faction
 * and technology passives, hero auras. Those are deliberately NOT folded in:
 * a module-faithful preview would need the match kernel, and — worse — would
 * leak the ENEMY's hidden bonuses (their researched techs, faction passives,
 * hero fittings) through the predicted numbers. The base model reads only unit
 * compositions, which is exactly what the viewer legitimately sees; when hidden
 * bonuses flip a close fight, that is the fog of war doing its job.
 *
 * Fog discipline is the CALLER's: feed it sides the viewer legitimately knows
 * (own units vs an identified world's garrison / an identified fleet; a client
 * naturally holds only the fog-projected state, so this is structural there).
