/**
 * Diplomacy actions (D2), on top of the D1 state primitives (`state/diplomacy.ts`).
 * The rule that shapes every action: moving a pair TOWARD war is unilateral (nobody
 * needs consent to break a promise), moving it TOWARD alliance needs both sides —
 * a standing offer (`state.diplomacyOffers`) the other party accepts or rejects.
 *
 *   - `diplomacy.declare {target, stance}` — unilateral DOWNGRADE, applied at once.
 *   - `diplomacy.propose {target, stance}` — offer an UPGRADE; one standing offer
 *     per pair (a newer proposal, from either side, replaces it).
 *   - `diplomacy.accept {from}` / `diplomacy.reject {from}` — resolve that offer.
 *
 * Any stance change voids the pair's pending offer (it was made under the old
 * relationship). Combat keeps reading stances straight off the state (D1 default:
 * unrecorded pair = war = FFA); this module only owns HOW stances change. The
 * `diplomacy` capability projects stances onto the coarse hostile/neutral/ally
 * relation for consumers that don't care about the pact/peace distinction.
