 * hand the WebSocket layer the right match to route a connection to. That lifts the
 * "one process = one match" limit: a single server process can host many ISOLATED
 * matches (no shared mutable state between them) instead of exactly one.
 *
 * Lifecycle (lazy load on demand, idle-evict / hibernation to the store) is a later
 * brick — this is the routing core. Read-only from the WS layer's perspective.
