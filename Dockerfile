# Deploys the Void Dominion prototype multiplayer server — the in-memory proto
# server that hosts the prototype's own world AND serves the game HTML at `/`. One
# deploy gives a permanent URL: both players just open it (the connect overlay
# auto-fills the same-origin wss://), pick Azure / Crimson, and play. State is
# in-memory and the handshake is unauthenticated — this is for testing, not prod.
#
#   docker build -t void-dominion . && docker run -p 8788:8788 void-dominion
#   (or one-click via render.yaml — see docs/multiplayer.md)
#
# Multi-stage: a full node:22-slim builder installs deps and bakes the prototype HTML,
# then a distroless runtime carries only the installed /app and runs `node` as non-root.
# Distroless drops the entire Debian userland (perl, pam, bsdutils, gpg, apt, …) that the
# Node-only server never touches — that base-OS layer was the source of nearly all the
# `trivy image` MEDIUM CVEs (audit SD-5.1 / F-15). It has no shell or package manager,
# which also removes the npm/corepack tooling the old single-stage image had to delete.
#
# Runtime note: `prototype/netserver.mjs` transpiles the server with esbuild AT STARTUP
# (writing packages/server/dist/proto-server.mjs) and the server appends to playtest-logs/.
# Both dirs are pre-created in the builder and the whole tree is owned by the non-root
# user, so those writes succeed without a writable top-level /app.

# ---- Stage 1: build (full toolchain) ----
# Both FROM lines are digest-pinned (audit F-15 / CWE-1357): a tag is mutable, a digest
# names the exact multi-arch index that was reviewed. To bump: re-resolve the tag's
# current digest (Docker Hub API `/v2/repositories/library/node/tags/22-slim` for node;
# `gcr.io/v2/distroless/nodejs22-debian13/manifests/nonroot` Docker-Content-Digest for
# distroless), update the digest + the refreshed-date below, and re-review .trivyignore.
# The dates live in these comments, not inline: a `#` after FROM's args would be parsed
# as extra arguments (Dockerfile comments only count at line start) and break the build.
# node:22-slim digest refreshed 2026-07.
